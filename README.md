# My Bachelor Thesis

I am almost finishing my graduation work for getting my Bachelor's degree! The name of my thesis is:

**AUTOMATIC WASTE SORTING EXPERIMENTATION USING A NOVEL SMART TRASH BIN WITH CNN**

That's a quite a mouthfull! Once you visit this [smart-trash-bin-my-thesis](https://github.com/jaimix4/smart-trash-bin-my-thesis) repository I did for showcasing a bit of the work done, it will be easy to understand!
